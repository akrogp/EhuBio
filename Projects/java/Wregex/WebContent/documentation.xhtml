		<h3><a id="overview">Overview</a></h3>
		<h:graphicImage name="tutorial/BasicSearch.png" style="float:right"/>
		<p>Wregex (weighted regular expression) offers a new approach for amino acid motif searching. Wregex
		combines a regular expression with an optional Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM). The regular
		expression is used to obtain a candidate list matching the desired conditions, and the PSSM
		is used for computing a score that can be used to select the most promising of those candidates.</p>
		<p>Wregex supports all motifs in <a href="http://elm.eu.org/">ELM</a> as regular expressions, and
		a PSSM has already been built for some of them. In the case your motif is not included in the list
		or a PSSM is not available, you can easily build your own as detailed later. Then you can also notify us
		your motif definition by sending a mail to <a href="mailto:wregex@ehubio.es">wregex@ehubio.es</a> and we will be
		happy to include it in the default motif list used in the basic search.</p>
		
		<h3><a id="search">Basic Search</a></h3>		
		<p>The basic search consists on searching a fasta file with protein sequences (provided by the user)
		for an amino acid motif selected in the dropdown lists (provided by Wregex). The first dropdown list
		contains the motifs available, and the second dropdown list (the one to the right) allows the user
		to select a specific motif configuration (different regular expressions and/or PSSMs).</p>
		<p>The dropdown list containing the motifs is divided in two parts, the first one contains entries
		specific of Wregex for which both a regular expression and a PSSM are available. The second part consists
		on <a href="http://elm.eu.org/">ELM</a> entries without a PSSM.</p>
		<p>Once a motif has been selected and an input fasta file uploaded, a search button will be shown. Clicking
		this button starts a new search and a list of candidates will be shown when finished (if there is any match).</p>
		<p>The grouping checkbox allows to configure whether overlapping candidates should be considered as
		a single entry or separated into multiple entries. An overlap occurs when there are several combinations
		that match the regular expression in the same region of the protein.</p>				
		<h:graphicImage name="tutorial/Results.png" style="float:right"/>
		<p>Results can be downloaded as a CSV file, useful for further analysis using any spreadsheet, or as
		a Clustal ALN file, which can be used to display the alignments of the results using the groups indicated
		between parenthesis () in the regular expression. These results are also displayed on a table with the following
		columns: protein accession/entry from the fasta header, starting and ending positions of the candidate motif within
		the protein sequence, candidate motif sequence with the regular expression groups indicated between dashes --,
		number of combinations grouped in the same entry (overlapping positions) and Wregex score (ranging from 0 to 100).
		Finally, if there are motif annotations with scores in the input fasta sequences, their score is also displayed
		as the assay score.</p>
		<p>A threshold (arbitrarily selected by the user) can be applied to Wregex scores, thus introducing a second
		filter for candidate motif selection. Based on our experience, a threshold value of 50 offers a good tradeoff
		between true positives and false positives.</p>		
		
		<h3><a id="custom">Custom Search</a></h3>
		<h:graphicImage name="tutorial/Custom.png" style="float:right"/>
		<p>In the motif dropdown list "Custom" can be selected to let the user enter a custom motif, consisting on
		a custom regular expression and an optional custom PSSM.</p>
		<p>The syntax for the regular expression is the one used by the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html" target="_blank">
		Pattern Java class</a>. For instance <tt>[LIMA].{2,3}[LIVMF]</tt> means any of leucine (L), isoleucine (I), methionine (M)
		or alanine (A) followed by 2 or 3 ({2,3}) occurrences of any (.) amino acid and then followed by any of
		leucine (L), isoleucine (I), valine (V), methionine (M) or phenylalanine (F).</p>
		<p>This regular expression can be complemented with a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) so that any
		match of the regular expression in the input fasta file will be assigned a score. In order to use a PSSM, the
		different positions must be indicated within the regular expression by using <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/groups.html" target="_blank">
		capturing groups</a>. Using the previous example, the following regular expression <tt>([LIMA])(.{2,3})([LIVMF])</tt>
		will match the same sequences than before but it will also define 3 positions: the first one consisting on
		the first hydrophobic amino acid, the second one on the 2-3 amino acid separation, and the third one on the
		final hydrophobic amino acid. Then, a custom PSSM indicating a weight for every amino acid in each of the
		three positions can be provided for computing a match score.</p>
		
		<h3><a id="training">Building a Custom PSSM</a></h3>		
		<p>A training web page is provided for allowing the user to build a custom PSSM. Basically this just requires
		two steps: 1) define a custom regular expression with capturing groups to indicate the PSSM positions, and 2)
		provide an input fasta file with the training sequences.</p>
		<h:graphicImage name="tutorial/InputMotifs2.png" style="float:right"/><h:graphicImage name="tutorial/InputMotifs1.png" style="float:right"/>
		<p>The regular expression must be indicated in the corresponding input text box of the training page. Then
		clicking in the input motifs button will open a new input motifs page. In this input motifs page an input fasta file with
		the training sequences must be selected. Then a table will be displayed when the user can assign a weight to
		each of the matches, and even re-define the position of the match if it is a part of a larger motif.
		The "Matched" column displays the number of matches of the custom regex within the motif position range defined.
		This number will be used to divide the motif weight between the different matches when building the PSSM.</p>
		<p>The resulting training motif list can be downloaded as a fasta file. This file will have annotations of
		the motif positions and weights that will be recovered if the same file is used later for further training.</p>
		<h:graphicImage name="tutorial/Training.png" style="float:right"/>
		<p>Once the input motif list has been completed, clicking again in the training page will show the list of
		training matches. Each of these matches will display the weight of the matched input motif, and the score resulting
		from dividing this weight between the number of matches for that motif ("!"). If any of the matches is known to be
		not valid, it can be disabled just by clicking the recycle bin icon in the "Action" column. This will display
		a not-valid icon in the corresponding row, and decrease the number of matches for the corresponding motif.
		This will also update the divided weight since the original input motif weight will be distributed between the
		remaining matches for that motif. Any disabled match can be re-enabled at any time just by clicking the recycle
		icon in the "Action" column.</p>
		<p>Once the user finishes validating the list of training matches, the resulting PSSM can be downloaded to
		a local file. This file can then be selected together with the custom regex for being used in the custom
		search option described above.</p>
		<p>If you define a custom regex and custom PSSM that you think they could be of interest for others,
		please send then by mail to <a href="mailto:wregex@ehubio.es">wregex@ehubio.es</a> indicating also references
		to any paper from you or others supporting that evidence. We will be happy to include that custom motif
		in the dropdown list to share it through the basic search.</p>
		
		<h3><a id="local">Running Wregex on your Local PC</a></h3>
		<p>In case you need intensive Wregex execution, you could opt to run it locally on your PC. This can be
		done by running it on a local servlet 2.5 container like Apache Tomcat, or creating a custom Java front-end
		using the provided Wregex Java class. Both the *.war binary file and the Java code can be accessed from the
		Downloads page.</p>
		<p>Wregex execution at wregex.ehubio.es has some constraints, i.e. input fasta file size and execution time
		in order to avoid denial of service to other users. This constrains can be avoided when running Wregex
		locally. For more information, please go to the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/ehu-bio/wiki/Wregex" target="_blank">
		Wregex Google Code page</a></p>.
